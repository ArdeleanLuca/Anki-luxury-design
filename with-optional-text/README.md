## With Optional Text

This version includes **additional helper text** on the front and back cards,
designed to support guided learning and gradual exposure.

It is intended for:
- Beginners and intermediate learners
- Users who are still learning kana or new symbols
- Gradual transition from guided study to full immersion

The layout and styling remain identical to the clean version, with the only difference
being the presence of optional text elements.

### Files
- `front.html` – Front card template
- `back.html` – Back card template
- `styling.css` – Card styling

### Usage
Copy the contents of:
- `front.html` into **Front Template**
- `back.html` into **Back Template**
- `styling.css` into **Styling**

This version is ideal during early and intermediate stages of learning,
when additional visual or textual guidance is still useful.
