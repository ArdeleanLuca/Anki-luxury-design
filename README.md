Built using **HTML and in-app CSS**, fully compatible with Anki’s card editor.

This design focuses on readability, spacing, and a premium visual feel,
while staying simple and distraction-free.

## 📂 Versions

### 🔤 With optional text
Located in `with-optional-text/`

This version includes additional helper text on the front and back cards.
I personally use this variant because I am still learning **kana** and want
a **gradual exposure** to symbols instead of full immersion from day one.

**Files:**
- `front.html`
- `back.html`

**Preview:**

Located in `without-optional-text/`

Ideal for advanced learners or full immersion study.
