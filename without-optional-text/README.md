## Without Optional Text

This version provides a **clean, distraction-free Anki card design** without any additional helper text on the front or back cards.

It is intended for:
- Advanced learners
- Full immersion study
- Users who prefer a minimal interface with no guidance text

The layout and styling remain identical to the main design, with the only difference being the removal of optional text elements.

### Usage
